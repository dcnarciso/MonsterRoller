# MonsterRoller
Webscraping tool designed to make D&amp;D a little easier.

Once run, input the monster name as it appears in the Roll20.net bestiary, the number of monsters, ranged or melee attack, and the target's AC.

Running the scrape_data function through ipython or similar takes the arguments all at once.
